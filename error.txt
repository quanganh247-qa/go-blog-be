Failed to save 'querier.go': Unable to write file 'vscode-remote://wsl+ubuntu/home/quanganh/back_end/dhqanh-be/app/db/sqlc/querier.go' (NoPermissions (FileSystemError): Error: EACCES: permission denied, open '/home/quanganh/back_end/dhqanh-be/app/db/sqlc/querier.go')

The output of the ls -l command shows that the querier.go file is owned by the root user, which is why you're having trouble modifying it with your regular user account. Here's how you can resolve this:

1. Change Ownership of the File
Since the file is owned by root, you'll need to change the ownership to your user (quanganh). You can do this with the chown command:

sudo chown quanganh:quanganh /home/quanganh/back_end/dhqanh-be/app/db/sqlc/querier.go
